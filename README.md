# Nix-Everything-Guides
## What is this repo?
This repository is my attempt at making guides that are easy to understand on:
- Nix,
- [NixOS](nixos/README.md),
- NixPkgs.

It's mostly aimed at users new to the Nix ecosystem. If you have any issues (with the documentation or while using Nix/NixOS/NixPkgs), requests, or suggestions please make an issue. Each solution to an issue will be added to the documentation.

It's also a reference material for me.

## Why did I make this repo?

In my opinion the official documentation, while improving, is still heavy on terminology and light on explaination. While I could contribute to the official documentation, there are a few reasons why I don't want to do that:
- I'm not confident that I have deep enough understanding for that. The barrier of entry to contribute seems high.
- There are so many issues and pull requests which the maintainers have to deal with, that my questions and attempts would only waste their time. This repo will allow me to experiment freely.

If this documentation gets more traction I'm not against merging it with the official documentation.

# Configuration Overview

There are two main ways to configure your NixOS system:

- default configuration
- flakes

There is also home-manager, but that's a completely separate topic, as it's not
native.

In my opinion, you should start with the default configuration, then move to
flakes, and then add home-manager at the end if you wish. Unless you don't want
to use flakes, in which case you can skip them and go straight to home-manager.
